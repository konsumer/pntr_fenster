This is a minimal frame for [pntr](https://github.com/RobLoach/pntr) graphics, input and sound using [fenster](https://github.com/zserge/fenster).

Eventually, I might set it up as a backend for [pntr_app](https://github.com/robloach/pntr_app), but initially I just want to make a very small & light shell.
